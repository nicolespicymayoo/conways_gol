We are going to build a real life Conway's Game of Life!

Here's the Wiki description.... 
============================================ 
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square "cells", each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or "populated" and "unpopulated" respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
===========================================

We are going to make some modifications, however. Instead of infinite grid, let's fix the size. Also we want a working version in 2 hrs, so we advise to start small and enhance and prettify later. We don't expect you to complete every feature, but here's a rough order in priority...
1. User can seed the initial state.
2. User can step from generation to generation
3. User can play/pause (and results are displayed at a reasonable speed)
4. User can reset the board.
5. User can change board size.

step: 
  - each generation is a pure function of the preceding one
